I've seen quite a few of Bret Victor's videos and they always blow me away. I want to explore and come up with my own creative tools. I've decided to recreate one of his tools to help me more fully grasp the concepts he explains. Right now I'm stuck in old programming paradigms and I need help to open up my mind. There's no better way to understand something than to create it yourself.

(todo:: screenshot goes here)

## Goals

 - Have Fun.
 - Gain better understanding of next-gen creation tools.
 - Extract out library for storing/evaluating visual equations. (i.e. "(energy in KWh) / 1000" )
 - Extract out library for dragging numbers to adjust them.

## To Hack On It

Make sure you have node installed. Optionally, you can install a live-reload plugin in your browser.

 - `npm install -g webpack`
 - `npm install`
 - `webpack -w`
 - optional: `npm start` (this starts live reload)

## Todo

 - [ ] Setup basic styles and layout
 - [ ] Starting off with the "Data" section
